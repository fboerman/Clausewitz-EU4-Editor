Clausewitz-EU4-Editor
=====================

A mod editor for the grand strategy game Europa Universalis 4 made by Paradox Interactive on the Clausewitz engine. This editor will first focus on country editing but later on editing for ideas, cultures and religions will be added.
The editor is written in C# and available under the GPL v2 license. You need the .net framework 4.5 in order to run it.

Credit for the design goes to asiom.
